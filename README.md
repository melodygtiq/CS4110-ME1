Alan Turing introduced the "Imitation Game," which we now know as the Turing Test. This test is about whether a machine can imitate human behavior so well that it becomes hard to tell the difference between the two. Instead of diving into abstract ideas about what intelligence really is, Turing provided a simple, practical way to see if machines could think like humans.

What’s truly impressive about Turing’s work is how forward-thinking it was. He imagined machines doing things we now consider routine, like understanding language or solving problems. His ideas didn’t just shape the development of artificial intelligence; they also opened up important conversations about the ethical and philosophical questions around creating machines that can think. Turing’s ability to mix science with big-picture thinking makes his work a key piece in both technology and what it means to be human.
